About this example
==================
    This example illustrates how to use the ModelBuilder class
    to read and write an XML message type that contains multiple schema (xsd)
    namespaces and/or multiple evolving schema versions.

    This example defines a model for reading/writing a selection of the Smooks
    configuration namespaces (CSV and Javabean).  It supports multiple
    versions of each of these namespaces, binding their data into a single object
    model and maintaining namespace integrity when writing back out the models.

    See:
        1.  The Main class which executes the ModelBuilder (in src/main/java).
        2.  The Java model for the multiple supported namespaces (in src/main/java).
        3.  The binding configurations for each of the namespaces in the "v1_2" etc
            folders within "csv" and "javabean" packages (in src/main/java).
        4.  The serialization freemarker templates (.ftl) for each of the namespaces in the "v1_2" etc
            folders within "csv" and "javabean" packages (in src/main/java).
        5.  The "smooks-config.xml" file is the input file read by the ModelBuilder
            from within the Main class.
