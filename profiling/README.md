About this example
==================
    This is an example that illustrates how Smooks can be
    used to apply "profile" based transformations on a message.

    Using profiles, you can share common transformation configurations
    across all messages that share the same profiles.

    See:
        1. The "Main" class in src/main/java/example/Main.java.
        2. The input message in input-message.xml.
        3. smooks-config.xml.  Pay specific attention to the "profile"
           info in the config.
